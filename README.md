## ABSTRACT

The Smart Home Automation System designed in this project aims to promote comfort, efficiency, and security through the integration of smart control of important home appliances and systems. Integrated around the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller that has both general input/output functionality and Wi-Fi, the system manages lighting, motion, temperature sensing, and simple physical actuation.  

The utilization of low-cost sensors like the Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and an LM393 comparator, IR motion sensors (TSSP58038), and NTC thermistors enables the NodeMCU to sense real-time conditions and make decisions regarding appliance control.  

- Variation in ambient light intensity can automatically switch on lighting systems.
- Motion detection can activate alarms or servo motors to mimic door movement.
- NTC thermistor readings allow temperature-based actions such as starting fans or sending alerts.
- Manual override is possible through push buttons.
- Real-time wireless control via IoT protocols like HTTP and MQTT supports smartphone/computer monitoring.

Overall, this system demonstrates how affordable and programmable hardware can transform homes into smart living spaces, with scalability for AI, voice assistants, cloud, and more.

## INTRODUCTION

Advances in embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) have revolutionized the way humans interact with their homes. ‚ÄúSmart home‚Äù now implies an interactive environment where appliances react dynamically based on:

- User commands
- Environmental conditions
- Scheduling
- Remote control

This system focuses on **low-cost, scalable, and dependable** automation.  
The NodeMCU ESP8266 serves as the project‚Äôs core, offering:

- Built-in Wi-Fi
- Digital and analog interfaces
- Low power consumption
- Arduino IDE compatibility

**Sensors used:**
- LDR with LM393 comparator
- NTC temperature sensor
- IR motion sensor

**Outputs:**
- LEDs
- Buzzers
- Servo motor

Control can be **local (push button)** or **remote (web/mobile over Wi-Fi)**.

## SYSTEM DESIGN

The system is structured into **three subsystems**:

### 1. Input Sensing
- **LDR + LM393 Comparator**: Detects ambient light changes, triggers lights when below threshold.
- **IR Motion Sensor (TSSP58038)**: Detects movement and triggers security actions.
- **NTC Thermistor**: Reads analog temperature data via NodeMCU‚Äôs ADC (A0).
- **Push Buttons**: Allows manual override.

### 2. Processing & Control
- NodeMCU processes inputs via Arduino C/C++ code.
- Conditional logic controls outputs.
- Debouncing ensures clean button input.

### 3. Outputs/Actuators
- **LEDs** for status/light automation.
- **Buzzer** for alerts.
- **Servo Motor** for door simulation.
- **Wireless control** (HTTP/Blynk/MQTT).
